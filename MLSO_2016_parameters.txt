#
# GENERAL IMAGE SETTINGS:
# data_source: type of image to be processed (MLSO2014, MLSO2016, ECL1)
# Xcenter, Ycenter: position of the Sun disk center, pixels
# Rot_angle: initial rotation angle (used for inital image plane derotation)
# Rs: radius of the Sun disk to be excluded fom processing, pixels 
# d_roi: distance (in pixels) in x and y directions from the disk center defining outer edges of the ROI
# png_channel: PNG channel to be used if image data is in PNG format
#
# BLOB FILTERING PARAMETERS:
# blob_filt_min, blob_detect_min: minimum size of image blobs to be included during noise filtering and detection
# blob_detect_thresh_pairs: number of pairs of min amd max pixel values (in the processed image) used to detect features
# blob_detect_thresholds: detection thresholds, sorted by [min, max] pairs. Total number of thresholds must be 2 x  blob_detect_thresh_pairs.
#
# FEATURE FILTERING parameters:
# L_min, L_max: allowed range of feature length (in discrete rectangular coordinates)
# Phi_min, Phi_max: excluded range of polar angles (in radians), used to remove persistent MLSO artifacts
# Alpha_min, Alpha_max: allowed range of average relative angles (in radians) measured wrt local radial direciton 
# Flux_rho_trend_min, Flux_rho_trend_max: allowed range of average fluxes along the feature computed using averaged radial trend
#
# FEATURE FITTING PARAMETERS:
# blob_detect_n_segments: number of segments in each interpolated feature used to compute orientaiton angles
#
